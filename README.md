# SET-AND-SET-OPERATION
A set is a collection of unique elements. Set operations include union (combining elements from multiple sets), intersection (common elements between sets), difference (elements in one set but not another), and symmetric difference (elements in either set but not both). These operations help efficiently manage and analyze data.
